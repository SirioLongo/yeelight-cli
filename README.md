# yeelight-cli
    cargo install yee
This is a cross-platform command line client for Xiaomi's Yeelight. It is a very low-level implementation, and I believe it is possible to build somehing on top of this, maybe even a GUI. This still needs a lot of work to be full-featured, however, I believe it is usable at this stage.

You can use any method in [Yeelight Specification](http://www.yeelight.com/download/Yeelight_Inter-Operation_Spec.pdf) as long as your device supports it, as this program is essentially a wrapper around it. 
You need to enable LAN Control using the official Yeelight mobile app before attempting to use this, or any other 3rd party client.

I encountered many difficulties developing this as the only source codes I was able to found was from non-English speaking developers and it made reading comments and grasping difficult parts hard. I believe this can act as a guide for developers who are new to writing programs for this kind of devices, especially Yeelight.
